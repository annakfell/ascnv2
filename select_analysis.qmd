This section covers how to choose appropriate analyses for any number and type of measurements. 
Think like, flow chart. 

**Considerations:**

* Purpose of analysis.  
* Types of variables in data set.  
* Data used in analysis.   
* Assumptions needed; satisfied?  
* Choice of analyses is often arbitrary: consider several  

**Example:** 

5 independent variables: 3 interval, 1 ordinal, 1 nominal  

1 dependent variable: interval

Analysis options  

- Multiple regression: pretend independent ordinal variable is an
  interval variable use dummy (0 /1) variables for nominal variables
- Analysis of variance: categorize all independent variables
- Analysis of covariance: leave variables as is, check assumptions
- Logistic regression: Categorize dependent variable: high, low
- Survival analysis: IF dependent variable is time to an event

Unsure? Do several and compare results.
