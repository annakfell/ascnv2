In its primary sense, it refers to a basic truth, law, assumption, or rule.\n\nThis third definition (3) is the context in which we will be using this term. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## When is Principal Components Analysis (PCA) used? \n\n* simplify the description of a set of interrelated variables. \n* transform a set of correlated variables, to a new set of uncorrelated variables\n* dimension reduction: collapse many variables into a few number of variables while maintaining the same amount of variation present in the data. \n    - Statistical modeling is all about explaining variance in an outcome based on the variance in predictors. \n    - The new variables are called principal components, and they are ordered by the amount of variance they contain. \n    - So the first few principal components, may contain the same amount of variance (information) contained in a much larger set of original variables. \n* multivariable outlier detection\n    - individual records that have high values on the principal components variables are candidates for outliers or blunders on multiple variables. \n* as a solution for multicollinearity\n    - often is it useful to obtain the first few principal components corresponding to a set of highly correlated X variables, and then conduct regression analysis on the selected components. \n* as a step towards factor analysis (next section)\n* as an exploratory technique that may be used in gaining a better understanding of the relationships between measures. \n\n\n\n**_Not_ variable selection**\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA) differs from variable selection in two ways:\n\n1. No dependent variable exists\n2. Variables are not eliminated but rather summary variables, i.e., principal components, are computed from all of the original variables. \n\nWe are trying to understand a phenomenon by collecting a series of component measurements, but the underlying mechanics is complex and not easily understood by simply looking at each component individually. The data could be redundant and high levels of multicolinearity may be present. \n\n\n\n## Basic Idea - change of coordinates {#basic-idea}\n\nLet's simulate a data set that consists of 100 random pairs of observations $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ that are correlated. Let $X_{1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(100, 100)$, $X_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(50, 50)$, with $\\rho$ the correlation between $X_{1}$ and $X_{12}$ set to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. \n\nIn matrix notation this is written as: $\\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{\\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\right)$ where \n$$\\mathbf{\\mu} = \n  \\left(\\begin{array}\n  {r}\n  \\mu_{1} \\\\\n  \\mu_{2}\n  \\end{array}\\right), \n  \\mathbf{\\Sigma} = \n  \\left(\\begin{array}\n  {cc}\n  \\sigma_{1}^{2} & \\rho\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2} \\\\\n  \\rho\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2} & \\sigma_{2}^{2} \n  \\end{array}\\right)\n$$. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](PCA_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Create two new variables $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ as linear combinations of $\\mathbf{x_{1}}$ and $\\mathbf{x_{2}}$ \n\n$$ \\mathbf{C_{1}} = a_{11}\\mathbf{x_{1}} + a_{12}\\mathbf{x_{2}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{C_{2}} = a_{21}\\mathbf{x_{1}} + a_{22}\\mathbf{x_{2}} $$\n\nor more simply $\\mathbf{C = aX}$, where\n\n* The $\\mathbf{x}$'s have been centered by subtracting their mean ($\\mathbf{x_{1}} = x_{1}-\\bar{x_{1}}$)\n* $Var(C_{1})$ is as large as possible \n\nGraphically we're creating two new axes, where now $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are uncorrelated. \n\n> PCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\n\n\n![](images/pca_coord_rotate.png)\n\nIn Linear Algebra terms, this is a [change of basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis). We are changing from a coordinate system of $(x_{1},x_{2})$ to $(c_{1}, c_{2})$. If you want to see more about this concept, here is a good [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=13). \n\n## More Generally\n\nWe want\n\n* From $P$ original variables $X_{1}, \\ldots , X_{P}$ get $P$ principal components $C_{1}, \\ldots , C_{P}$\n* Where each $C_{j}$ is a linear combination of the $X_{i}$'s: $C_{j} = a_{j1}X_{1} + a_{j2}X_{2} + \\ldots + a_{jP}X_{P}$\n* The coefficients are chosen such that $Var(C_{1}) \\geq Var(C_{2}) \\geq \\ldots \\geq Var(C_{P})$\n    - Variance is a measure of information. Consider modeling prostate cancer. \n        * Gender has 0 variance. No information.\n        * Size of tumor: the variance is > 0, it provides useful information. \n* Any two PC's are uncorrelated: $Cov(C_{i}, C_{j})=0, \\quad \\forall i \\neq j$\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n  \\left[\n    \\begin{array}{r}\n      C_{1} \\\\\n      C_{2} \\\\\n      \\vdots \\\\\n      C_{P}\n    \\end{array}\n  \\right] \n  = \n  \\left[\n    \\begin{array}{cccc}\n      a_{11} & a_{12} & \\ldots & a_{1P} \\\\\n      a_{21} & a_{22} & \\ldots & a_{2P} \\\\\n      \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n      a_{P1} & a_{P2} & \\ldots & a_{PP} \n    \\end{array}\n  \\right]\n  \\left[\n    \\begin{array}{r}\n      X_{1} \\\\\n      X_{2} \\\\\n      \\vdots \\\\\n      X_{P}\n  \\end{array}\n  \\right] \n$$\n\n\n* Hotelling (1933) showed that the columns of the matrix $a_{ij}$ are solutions to $(\\mathbf{\\Sigma} -\\lambda\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{a}=\\mathbf{0}$. \n    - $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the $\\mathbf{X}$ variables.  \n* This means $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\\mathbf{a}$ an eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$.\n    - (Optional) Learn more about eigenvalues [[in this video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=14). \n* Problem: There are infinite number of possible $\\mathbf{a}$'s\n* Solution: Choose $a_{ij}$'s such that the sum of the squares of the coefficients for any one\n  eigenvector is = 1. \n    - $P$ unique eigenvalues and $P$ corresponding eigenvectors. \n\nWhich gives us \n\n* Variances of the $C_{j}$'s add up to the sum of the variances of the original variables (total variance).\n* Can be thought of as variance decomposition into orthogonal (independet) vectors (variables). \n* With $Var(C_{1}) \\geq Var(C_{2}) \\geq \\ldots \\geq Var(C_{P})$. \n\n## R commands\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Corresponding reading\nPMA6 Ch 14.3-14.4\n:::\n\n\nCalculating the principal components in R can be done using the function `prcomp()`, `princomp()` and functions from the `factoextra` package.

The correlation between $C_{i}$ and standardized variable $x_{j}$ can be written as $r_{ij} = a_{ij}SD(C_{i})$\n\nThis last point means that for any given $C_{i}$ we can quantify the relative degree of dependence of the PC on each of the standardized variables.

They are ordinal categorical variables, but they are not truly interval measures since the \"distance\" between 0 and 1 (rarely and some of the time), would not be considered the same as the distance between 2 (moderately) and 3 (most or all of the time). And \"moderately\" wouldn't be necessarily considered as \"twice\" the amount of \"rarely\". \n\nOur options to use these ordinal variables in a model come down to three options. \n\n* convert to a factor and include it as a categorical (series of indicators) variable. \n    - This can be even more problematic when there are 20 categorical variables. You run out of degrees of freedom very fast with that many predictors. \n* leave it as numeric and treat it as pseudo-continuous ordinal measure. Where you can interpret as \"as x increases y changes by...\", but \n* aggregate across multiple likert-type-ordinal variables and create a new calculated scale variable that can be treated as continuous.\n    - This is what PCA does by creating new variables $C_{1}$ that are linear combinations of the original $x's$. \n\nIn this example I use PCA to reduce these 20 correlated variables down to a few uncorrelated variables that explain the most variance. \n\n**1.

While this is a validate measure, what if some components (e.g. had crying spells) contributes more to someones level of depression than another measure (e.g. people were unfriendly). Since the PC's are linear combinations of the $x$'s, the coefficients $a$, or the loadings, aren't all equal as we've seen. So let's see if the first two PC's (since that's what was chosen from the scree plot) can predict chronic illness better than the straight summative score of `cesd`. \n\n**1.
