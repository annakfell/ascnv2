There are links to additional resources at the end of this document for additional learning. \n\nThere are two audiences in mind when creating data visualizations: \n\n1. For your eyes only (FYEO). These are quick and dirty plots, without annotation. Meant to be looked at once or twice.\n2. To share with others. These need to completely stand on their own. Axes labels, titles, colors as needed, possibly captions.\n\nYou will see, and slowly learn, how to add these annotations and how to clean up your graphics to make them sharable. `ggplot2` already does a lot of this work for you. \n\nWe will also use the two most common methods used to create plots. 1) Base graphics, 2) the `ggplot2` package. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you have not done so already, go ahead and install the `ggplot2` package now. \n\nFor **almost** every plot discussed we will create two types of plots\n\n1. FYEO - using base graphics. (Base == Comes with R) Very powerful, but can be technical. \n2. FYEO - using `ggplot2`. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. \n\nAs time permits I will update each section with a third type of plot - \n\n  3. Sharable - Contains all bells and whistles needed to make it presentable to others. \n\nYour task, should you choose to accept, is to follow along through this tutorial and at each step try to reproduce the plot shown. You can accomplish this by simply copying and pasting the syntax into a new R code (or R Markdown) document. \n\n## The syntax of `ggplot`\n\nThe reason we use the functions in `ggplot2` is for consistency in the structure \nof it's arguments. Here is a bare bones generic plotting function: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, col=col, fill=fill, group=group)) +  geom_THING() \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Required arguments\n\n* `data`: What data set is this plot using? This is ALWAYS the first argument.\n* `aes()`: This is the _aestetics_ of the plot. What's variable is on the x, what is on \n   the y? Do you want to color by another variable, perhaps fill some box by the value\n   of another variable, or group by a variable. \n* `geom_THING()`: Every plot has to have a geometry. What is the shape of the thing you \n   want to plot? Do you want to plot points - use `geom_points()`. Want to connect those\n   points with a line? Use `geom_lines()`. We will see many varieties in this lab. \n   \n### Optional but helpful arguments\n\n* `ggtitle`: This is the overall plot title\n* `xlab()` and `ylab()` axis titles. \n* scale_xy_blah to extend limits\n* scale_fill_blah to specifying a fixed color, and change auto legend title\n* themes\n\nFor a **full** , and comprehensive tutorial and reference guide on how to do nearly anything in ggplot -- this is by far my favorite reference http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/ I reference things in there (like how to remove or change the title of a legend) constantly. \n\n\n## The Data\n\nWe will use a subset of the `diamonds` dataset that comes with the `ggplot2` package. This dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. Review `?diamonds` to learn about the variables we will be using. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(\"diamonds\")\nset.seed(1410) # Make the sample reproducible\ndsmall <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Univariate Visualizations\n\n### Categorical variables\nBoth Nominal and Ordinal data types can be visualized using the same methods: tables, barcharts and pie charts. \n\n#### Tables\nTables are the most common way to get summary statistics of a categorical variable. The `table()` function produces a frequency table, where each entry represents the number of records in the data set holding the corresponding labeled value. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(dsmall$cut)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n     Fair      Good Very Good   Premium     Ideal \n       34        99       220       257       390 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are 27 Fair quality diamonds, 83 good quality and 387 Ideal quality diamonds in this sample. \n\n#### Barcharts / Barplots\nA Barchart or barplot takes these frequencies, and draws bars along the X-axis where the height of the bars is determined by the frequencies seen in the table. \n\n**base**\nTo create a barplot/barchart in base graphics requires the data to be in summarized in a table form first. Then the result of the table is plotted. The first argument is the table to be plotted, the `main` argument controls the title. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndc <- table(dsmall$cut)\nbarplot(dc, main=\"Barchart using base graphics\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\nThe geometry needed to draw a barchart in ggplot is `geom_bar()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut)) + geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**pretty**\nThe biggest addition to a barchart is the numbers on top of the bars. This isn't mandatory, but it does make it nice. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut)) + theme_bw() + \n    geom_bar(aes(y = ..count..)) + ggtitle(\"Frequnency of diamonds by cut type\") + \n    geom_text(aes(y=..count.. + 10, label=..count..), stat='count', size = 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(count)` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Plotting Proportions\nOften you don't want to compare counts but percents. To accomplish this, we have to aggregate the data to calculate the proportions first, then plot the aggregated data using `geom_col` to create the columns.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncut.props <- data.frame(prop.table(table(dsmall$cut)))\ncut.props # what does this data look like? \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       Var1  Freq\n1      Fair 0.034\n2      Good 0.099\n3 Very Good 0.220\n4   Premium 0.257\n5     Ideal 0.390\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cut.props, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_col() + \n  ylab(\"Proportion\") + xlab(\"Cut type\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Proportion of diamonds by cut type\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Cleveland Dot Plots\nAnother way to visualize categorical data that takes up less ink than bars is a Cleveland dot plot. Here again we are plotting summary data instead of the raw data. This uses the `geom_segment` that draws the lines from x=0 to the value of the proportion (named `Freq` because of the way `data.frame` works).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cut.props, aes(x=Freq, y=Var1)) +  \n  geom_point(size = 3) + xlab(\"Proportion of diamonds\") + \n  theme_bw() + ylab(\"Cut Type\") +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=0, xend=Freq, y=Var1, yend=Var1), color='grey50')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Pie Chart\n\nJust like `barplot()`, `pie()` takes a table object as it's argument. \n\n**base**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndc <- table(dsmall$cut)\npie(dc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPie charts are my _least_ favorite plotting type. Human eyeballs can't distinguish between angles as well as we can with heights. A mandatory piece needed to make the wedges readable is to add the percentages of each wedge. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npie(dc, labels = paste0(names(dc), ' (', prop.table(dc)*100, \"%)\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\n\nAnd here I thought pie charts couldn't get worse... i'm not a fan at all of the ggplot version. So i'm not even going to show it. Here's a link to another great tutorial that does show you how to make one. \n\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-pie-chart-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization\n\n\nHowever -- Never say never. Here's an example of a *good* use of pie charts. \nhttp://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2019/8/8/forty-five-pie-charts-never-say-never\n \n\n\n#### Waffle Chart \nThis type of chart is not natively found in the `ggplot2` package, but it's own `waffle` package. These are great for infographics. \n\nReference: https://www.r-bloggers.com/making-waffle-charts-in-r-with-the-new-waffle-package/ \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nwaffle(dc/10, rows=5, size=0.5, \n       title=\"Cut quality of diamond\", \n       xlab=\"1 square == 10 diamonds\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Continuous Measures\nHere we can look at the price, carat, and depth of the diamonds. \n\n#### Dotplot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(dsmall$depth)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe base function `plot()` creates a **dotplot** for a continuous variable. The value of the variable is plotted on the y axis, and the index, or row number, is plotted on the x axis. This gives you a nice, quick way to see the values of the data. \n\nOften you are not interested in the individual values of each data point, but the _distribution_ of the data. In other words, where is the majority of the data? Does it look symmetric around some central point? Around what values do the bulk of the data lie? \n\n#### Histograms\nRather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a \\emph{bin}. **The height of the bars in a histogram display the frequency of values that fall into those of those bins.** For example if we cut the poverty rates into 7 bins of equal width, the frequency table would look like this: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(cut(dsmall$depth, 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n(55.3,57.6] (57.6,59.8] (59.8,62.1] (62.1,64.4] (64.4,66.7] (66.7,68.9] \n          6          79         536         351          23           3 \n(68.9,71.2] \n          2 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a histogram, the binned counts are plotted as bars into a histogram. Note that the x-axis is continuous, so the bars touch. This is unlike the barchart that has a categorical x-axis, and vertical bars that are separated.\n\n**base**\nYou can make a histogram in base graphics super easy. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(dsmall$depth)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd it doesn't take too much to clean it up. Here you can specify the number of bins by specifying how many `breaks` should be made in the data (the number of breaks controls the number of bins, and bin width) and use `col` for the fill color. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(dsmall$depth, xlab=\"depth\", main=\"Histogram of diamond depth\", col=\"cyan\", breaks=20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe binwidth here is set by looking at the cut points above that were used to create 7 bins. Notice that darkgrey is the default fill color, but makes it hard to differentiate between the bars. So we'll make the outline black using `colour`, and `fill` the bars with white. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_histogram(colour=\"black\", fill=\"white\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of diamond depth\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote I did **not** specify the `binwidth` argument here. The size of the bins can hide features from your graph, the default value for ggplot2 is range/30 and usually is a good choice. \n\n\n#### Density plots\nTo get a better idea of the true shape of the distribution we can \"smooth\" out the bins and create what's called a `density` plot or curve. Notice that the shape of this distribution curve is much more... \"wigglier\" than the histogram may have implied. \n\n**base**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(density(dsmall$depth))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAwesome title huh? (NOT)\n\n\n**ggplot2**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Histograms + density \nOften is is more helpful to have the density (or kernel density) plot _on top of_ a histogram plot. \n\n**Base**\nSince the height of the bars in a histogram default to showing the frequency of records in the data set within that bin, we need to 1) scale the height so that it's a _relative frequency_, and then use the `lines()` function to add a `density()` line on top. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(dsmall$depth, prob=TRUE)\nlines(density(dsmall$depth), col=\"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\nThe syntax starts the same, we'll add a new geom, `geom_density` and color the line blue. Then we add the histogram geom using `geom_histogram` but must specify that the y axis should be on the density, not frequency, scale. Note that this has to go inside the aesthetic statement `aes()`. I'm also going to get rid of the fill by using `NA` so it doesn't plot over the density line. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_density(col=\"blue\") + \n  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour=\"black\", fill=NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Boxplots\nAnother very common way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is using a boxplot. Boxplots are useful for quickly identifying where the bulk of your data lie. R specifically draws a \"modified\" boxplot where values that are considered outliers are plotted as dots. \n\n**base**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(dsmall$depth)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only axis labeled is the y=axis. Like a dotplot the x axis, or \"width\", of the boxplot is meaningless here. We can make the axis more readable by flipping the plot on it's side. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(dsmall$depth, horizontal = TRUE, main=\"Distribution of diamond prices\", xlab=\"Dollars\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal is a bit easier to read in my opinion. \n\n**ggplot**\nWhat about ggplot? ggplot doesn't really like to do univariate boxplots. We can get around that by specifying that we want the box placed at a specific x value. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo flip it horizontal you may think to simply swap x and y? Good thinking. Of course it wouldn't be that easy. So let's just flip the whole darned plot on it's coordinate axis. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Violin plots\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_violin()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Boxplot + Violin plots\nOverlaying a boxplot and a violin plot serves a similar purpose to Histograms + Density plots. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_violin() + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBetter appearance - different levels of transparency of the box and violin. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + xlab(\"\") + theme_bw() + \n              geom_violin(fill=\"blue\", alpha=.1) + \n              geom_boxplot(fill=\"blue\", alpha=.5, width=.2) + \n              theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n              axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n              axis.ticks.x=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Normal QQ plots\nThe last useful plot that we will do on a single continuous variable is to assess the _normality_ of the distribution. Basically how close the data follows a normal distribution. \n\n**base**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqqnorm(dsmall$price)\nqqline(dsmall$price, col=\"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe line I make red because it is a reference line. The closer the points are to following this line, the more \"normal\" the shape of the distribution is. Price has some pretty strong deviation away from that line. Below I have plotted what a normal distribution looks like as an example of a \"perfect\" fit. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- rnorm(1000)\nqqnorm(z)\nqqline(z, col=\"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\nqq (or qnorm) plots specifically plot the data against a theoretical distribution. That means in the `aes()` aesthetic argument we don't specify either x or y, but instead the `sample=` is the variable we want to plot. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(sample=price)) + stat_qq()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAdditional references on making qqplots in ggplot: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-qq-plot-quantile-quantile-graph-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization\n\n\n## Bivariate Visualizations\n\n### Categorical v. Categorical\n\n#### Two-way Frequency tables\nCross-tabs, cross-tabulations and two-way tables (all the same thing, different names) can be created by using the `table()` function. \n\nThe frequency table is constructed using the `table()` function. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(dsmall$cut, dsmall$color)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           \n             D  E  F  G  H  I  J\n  Fair       5  6  7  4  5  4  3\n  Good      18 23 11 16 17  7  7\n  Very Good 26 37 46 40 33 25 13\n  Premium   34 53 43 49 41 24 13\n  Ideal     54 63 79 92 53 34 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 Fair diamonds with color D, and 21 Ideal quality diamonds with color J.\n\n#### Two-way Proprtion tables\nChoose your percentages depending on your research question. What are you wanting to compare? \n\nBest practices: \n\n* Explanatory variable on the rows\n* Response variable on the columns\n* Calculate row %'s as the % of the response for each explanatory group. \n\nHere are demonstrations of how the interpretation of the percents change depending on what the denominator is. \n\n**Cell proportions**\n\nWrapping `prop.table()` around a table gives you the **cell** proportions. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(table(dsmall$cut, dsmall$color))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           \n                D     E     F     G     H     I     J\n  Fair      0.005 0.006 0.007 0.004 0.005 0.004 0.003\n  Good      0.018 0.023 0.011 0.016 0.017 0.007 0.007\n  Very Good 0.026 0.037 0.046 0.040 0.033 0.025 0.013\n  Premium   0.034 0.053 0.043 0.049 0.041 0.024 0.013\n  Ideal     0.054 0.063 0.079 0.092 0.053 0.034 0.015\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n0.4% of all diamonds are D color and Fair cut, 2.1% are J color and Ideal cut. \n\n**Row proportions**\n\nTo get the **row** proportions, you specify `margin=1`. The percentages now add up to 1 across the rows. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(prop.table(table(dsmall$cut, dsmall$color), margin=1),3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           \n                D     E     F     G     H     I     J\n  Fair      0.147 0.176 0.206 0.118 0.147 0.118 0.088\n  Good      0.182 0.232 0.111 0.162 0.172 0.071 0.071\n  Very Good 0.118 0.168 0.209 0.182 0.150 0.114 0.059\n  Premium   0.132 0.206 0.167 0.191 0.160 0.093 0.051\n  Ideal     0.138 0.162 0.203 0.236 0.136 0.087 0.038\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n14.8% of all Fair quality diamonds are color D. 5.4% of all Ideal quality diamonds have color J.\n\n**Column proportions**\n\nTo get the **column** proportions, you specify `margin=2`.

What if I wanted to better compare cut within color group? This is the **column** percentages. Just switch which variable is the x axis and which one is used to fill the colors!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=color, fill=cut)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFor more than 2 colors I do not recommend choosing the colors yourself. I know little about color theory so I use the built-in color palettes. Here is a [great cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf) about using color palettes. \n\nAnd this easy change is why we love `ggplot2`. \n\n\n### Grouped bar charts with percentages\nNot as easy as one would hope, but the solution is to calculate the desired percentages first and then plot the summary data using either `geom_bar(stat='identity')` or `geom_col()`. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalc.props <- diamonds %>% group_by(color, cut) %>%\n              summarise(count=n()) %>%\n              mutate(pct=round(count/sum(count),3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'color'.

Continuous \n\n#### Scatterplot\nThe most common method of visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables is by using a scatterplot. \n\n**base**\nBack to the `plot()` command. Here we use model notation again, so it's $y~x$. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(price~carat, data=dsmall)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLooks like for the most part as the carat value increases so does price. That makes sense. \n\n**ggplot**\nWith ggplot we specify both the x and y variables, and add a point. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**\n\n* http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/scatterplot.html  \n* https://www.r-bloggers.com/scatterplot-matrices/\n\n#### Adding lines to the scatterplots \nTwo most common trend lines added to a scatterplots are the \"best fit\" straight line and the \"lowess\" smoother line. \n\n**base**\nThe best fit line (in blue) gets added by using the `abline()` function wrapped around the linear model function `lm()`. Note it uses the same model notation syntax and the `data=` statement as the `plot()` function does. The lowess line is added using the `lines()` function, but the `lowess()` function itself doesn't allow for the `data=` statement so we have to use `$` sign notation. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(price~carat, data=dsmall)\nabline(lm(price~carat, data=dsmall), col=\"blue\")\nlines(lowess(dsmall$price~dsmall$carat), col=\"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**ggplot**\nWith ggplot, we just add a `geom_smooth()` layer. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere the point-wise confidence interval for this lowess line is shown in grey. If you want to turn the confidence interval off, use `se=FALSE`. Also notice that the smoothing geom uses a different function or window than the `lowess` function used in base graphics. \n\nHere it is again using the `ggplot` plotting function and adding another `geom_smooth()` layer for the `lm` (linear model) line in blue, and the lowess line (by not specifying a method) in red.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method=\"lm\", color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color=\"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Line plots\n\nLine plots connect each dot with a straight line.

The definition is _a particular aspect or feature of something_, or _one side of something many-sided, especially of a cut gem_. Basically instead of plotting the grouped graphics on the same plotting area, we let each group have it's own plot, or facet.  \n\nWe add a `facet_wrap()` and specify that we want to panel on the color group. Note the twiddle in front of color. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, fill=color)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~color)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-66-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe grid placement can be semi-controlled by using the `ncol` argument in the `facet_wrap()` statement. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, fill=color)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~color, ncol=4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-67-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to compare distributions across groups on the same scale, and our eyes can compare items vertically better than horizontally.

So I won't show those examples. \n\n### Three continuous\nContinuous variables can also be mapped to the size of the point.

So note that just because you **can** change an aesthetic, doesn't mean you should. And just because you can plot things on the same axis, doesn't mean you have to. \n\nBefore you share your plot with any other eyes, always take a step back and try to explain what it is telling you. If you have to take more than a minute to get to the point then it may be too complex and simpler graphics are likely warranted. \n\n\n-----\n\n## Troubleshooting \n\n**Problem:** Missing data showing up as a category in ggplot? \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nGet rid of that far right bar!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(NCbirths, aes(x=marital)) + geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-84-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Solution:** Use `dplyr` to select only the variables you are going to plot, then pipe in the `na.omit()` at the end.
