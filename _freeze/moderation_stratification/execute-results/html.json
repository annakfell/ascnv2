This section provides some motivation for why we need a single model formation that can accommodate more than a single predictor. \n\n>This section uses functions from the `ggdist` and `ggpubr` packages to help tidy and visualize results from regression models. It also uses functions from the `performance` and `glmnet` packages to perform model selection and assessment. \n\nThis section uses the additional following packages and data: \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### Packages Used\nThis chapter uses the following packages:  [ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/),\n[ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html),\n[performance](https://easystats.github.io/performance/),\n[glmnet](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/articles/glmnet.html),\nand the [penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html) data. \n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Moderation\n\n_Moderation_ occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable.\n\n* The third variable is referred to as the moderating variable or simply the moderator. \n* The moderator affects the direction and/or strength of the relationship between the explanatory ($x$) and response ($y$) variable.\n    - This tends to be an important \n* When testing a potential moderator, we are asking the question whether there is an association between two constructs, **but separately for different subgroups within the sample.**\n    - This is also called a _stratified_ model, or a _subgroup analysis_.\n\n### Motivating Example - Admissions at UC Berkeley\n\nSometimes moderating variables can result in what's known as [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). This has had legal consequences in the past at UC Berkeley. \n\n\nBelow are the admissions figures for Fall 1973 at UC Berkeley.\n\n|       | Applicants | Admitted |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Total | 12,763     | 41%      |\n| Men   | 8,442      | 44%      |\n| Women | 4,321      | 35%      |\n\n: Table of admissions rates at UC Berkeley in 1973\n\nIs there evidence of gender bias in college admissions? Do you think a difference of 35% vs 44% is too large to be by chance?\n\nDepartment specific data\n\n|            |            |          |            |          |            |          |\n|------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|----------|\n|            | All        |          | Men        |          | Women      |          |\n| Department | Applicants | Admitted | Applicants | Admitted | Applicants | Admitted |\n| A          | 933        | 64%      | 825        | 62%      | 108        | **82%**  |\n| B          | 585        | 63%      | 560        | 63%      | 25         | **68%**  |\n| C          | 918        | 35%      | 325        | 37%      | 593        | 34%      |\n| D          | 792        | 34%      | 417        | 33%      | 375        | **35%**  |\n| E          | 584        | 25%      | 191        | 28%      | 393        | 24%      |\n| F          | 714        | 6%       | 373        | 6%       | 341        | **7%**   |\n| Total      | 4526       | 39%      | 2691       | 45%      | 1835       | 30%      |\n\n: The table of admissions rates for the 6 largest departments show a different story.\n\nAfter adjusting for features such as size and competitiveness of the department, the pooled data showed a \"small but statistically significant bias in favor of women\".\n\n### Motivating Example: Association of flower parts\n\nLet's explore the relationship between the length of the sepal in an iris flower, and the length (cm) of its petal. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noverall <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) + \n                geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n                theme_bw()\n\nby_spec <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, col=Species)) + \n                  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n                  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position=\"top\")\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(overall, by_spec , ncol=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](moderation_stratification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe points are clearly clustered by species, the slope of the lowess line between virginica and versicolor appear similar in strength, whereas the slope of the line for setosa is closer to zero. This would imply that petal length for _Iris setosa_ may not be affected by the length of the sepal.\n\n## Stratification\n\nStratified models fit the regression equations (or any other bivariate analysis) for each subgroup of the population. \n\nThe mathematical model describing the relationship between Petal length ($Y$), and Sepal length ($X$) for each of the species separately would be written as follows: \n\n$$ Y_{is} \\sim \\beta_{0s} + \\beta_{1s}*x_{i} + \\epsilon_{is} \\qquad \\epsilon_{is} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}_{s})$$\n$$ Y_{iv} \\sim \\beta_{0v} + \\beta_{1v}*x_{i} + \\epsilon_{iv} \\qquad \\epsilon_{iv} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}_{v}) $$\n$$ Y_{ir} \\sim \\beta_{0r} + \\beta_{1r}*x_{i} + \\epsilon_{ir} \\qquad \\epsilon_{ir} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}_{r}) $$\n\nwhere $s, v, r$ indicates species _setosa, versicolor_ and _virginica_ respectively. \n  \n\nIn each model, the intercept, slope, and variance of the residuals can all be different. This is the unique and powerful feature of stratified models. The downside is that each model is only fit on the amount of data in that particular subset. Furthermore, each model has 3 parameters that need to be estimated: $\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}$, and $\\sigma^{2}$, for a total of 9 for the three models. The more parameters that need to be estimated, the more data we need. \n\n\n\n## Identifying a moderator\n\nHere are 3 scenarios demonstrating how a third variable can modify the relationship between the original two variables. \n\n* **Significant --\\> Non-Significant**\n    * Significant relationship at bivariate level\n    * We expect the effect to exist in the entire population\n    * Within at least one level of the third variable the strength of the relationship changes\n    * P-value is no longer significant within at least one subgroup\n\n* **Non-Significant --\\> Significant**\n    * Non-significant relationship at bivariate level\n    * We do not expect the effect to exist in the entire population\n    * Within at least one level of the third variable the relationship becomes significant\n    * P-value is now significant within at least one subgroup\n\n* **Change in Direction of Association**\n    * Significant relationship at bivariate level\n    * We expect the effect to exist in the entire population\n    * Within at least one level of the third variable the direction of the relationship changes\n    * Means change order, positive to negative correlation etc.\n\n\n## What to look for in each type of analysis\n\n* **ANOVA** - look at the $p$-value, $r$-squared, means, and the graph of the ANOVA and compare to those values in the Moderation (i.e., each level of third variable) output to determine if third variable is moderator or not.\n* **Chi-Square** - look at the $p$-value, the percents for the columns in the crosstab table, and the graph for the Chi-Square and compare to those values in the Moderation (i.e., each level of third variable) output to determine if third variable is a moderator or not.\n* **Correlation and Linear Regression** - look at the correlation coefficient ($r$), $p$-value, regression coefficients, $r$-squared, and the scatterplot. Compare to those values in the Moderation (i.e., each level of third variable) output to determine if third variable is a moderator or not.\n\n\n## Ex: Correlation \n\nCan we predict penguin body mass from the flipper length?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggscatter(pen, x=\"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", add = \"reg.line\", \n          color = \"island\", ellipse = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](moderation_stratification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nProbably, but the relationship between flipper length and body mass changes depending on what island they are found on.\n\n\n**Overall**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(pen$flipper_length_mm, pen$body_mass_g, use=\"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.8712018\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Stratified by species**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nby(pen, pen$species, function(x){\n  cor(x$flipper_length_mm, x$body_mass_g, use=\"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npen$species: Adelie\n[1] 0.4682017\n------------------------------------------------------------ \npen$species: Chinstrap\n[1] 0.6415594\n------------------------------------------------------------ \npen$species: Gentoo\n[1] 0.7026665\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThere is a strong, positive, linear relationship (r=.87) between the flipper length and body mass of penguins when ignoring the species. This association is attenuated however within each species. _Gentoo_ and _Chinstrap_ still have strong correlations between flipper length and body mass, $r$=.70 and .64 respectively. However _Adelie_ species penguins only have a moderate correlation with $r=.45$. \n\nSo does Species moderate the relationship between flipper length and body mass? Visually we see a difference, but it is likely not statistically significant. More on how to determine that in @sec-general-F.\n \n## Ex: Regression\n\nLet's explore the relationship between the length of the sepal in an iris flower, and the length (cm) of its petal. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noverall <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) + \n                geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n                theme_bw()\n\nby_spec <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, col=Species)) + \n                  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + \n                  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position=\"top\")\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(overall, by_spec , ncol=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](moderation_stratification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe points are clearly clustered by species, the slope of the lowess line between virginica and versicolor appear similar in strength, whereas the slope of the line for setosa is closer to zero.
